    Administrative Controls
-        Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
-        Secure SDLC

- What we should be doing is that role based access where I create a role, which is basically a group and I assigned the permissions that, that group needs to the role. Then I put the people that I want to do that roll into that group and now they have the permissions that they need, anybody in that role gets the permissions they need. If you're not in that role, you don't get those permissions and it helps to stymie the idea of like permission aggregation.
- Fact is, if I end up moving out of that group, it means that those permissions don't follow me. But if you assign them individually to me, you don't know if I moved from another group, you keep adding or not. I still have those or retain those permissions. >> Nailed it
