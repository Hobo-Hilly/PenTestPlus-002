Defense Detection and Avoidance
Objectives:

    List and describe common security controls that a penetration tester may encounter during a penetration test
    List and describe common tools and techniques used by penetration testers to detect and avoid common security controls

    Defenses
        Load Balancers
            Difficult to detect
                LBs are meant to be transparent
            DNS info
                nslookup itpro.tv
            WAFW00F
            nmap
            http headers
        WAF
            WAFW00F
            nmap --script=http-waf-detect.nse itpro.tv

            Detection Avoidance
                Encoding
                Encryption
        AV
            Assume it's presence
            Look for network traffic that is related to AV
                Updates
            Detection Avoidance
                Create custom programs/malware
                File-less malware
        Firewall
            Firewalking
            Detection Avoidance
                Fragmentation
                Use proxy
                Use decoys
