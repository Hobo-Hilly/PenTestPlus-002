Denial of Service
Objectives:

    Define Denial of Service and Distributed Denial of Service attacks
    Define Reflection and Amplification DoS/DDoS attacks
    Explain and demonstrate Volumetric, Protocol, and Application

    DoS and DDoS
    Reflection and Amplification
        Reflection
            Attacker spoofs Target IP and requests information
                "Trigger Packet"
            Requested info is then sent to Target
                Use Botnet for DDoS
        Amplification
            Like a reflection attack, but...
                Requested info payload is much larger than the Trigger Packet
                Examples include: DNS and NTP
    Volumetric vs Protocol vs Application
        Volumetric
            ICMP Flood
                Reflection networks are useful here
                Requests and Replies saturates the network
                    hping3 --flood --spoof 192.168.241.133 --icmp -p 53 192.168.241.130
            Smurf & Fraggle
                DDoS target with ICMP echo replies
                    Send ICMP echo request to network broadcast address with spoofed source IP of target
                    If network allows directed broadcast requests, all hosts on network will respond to target with ICMP echo replies
                        hping3 --flood --spoof --icmp 192.168.241.130 192.168.241.255
                Fraggle
                    Similar to Smurf
                        UDP instead of ICMP
                        Targets ports 7(Echo) and 19(CHARGEN)
        Protocol
            Ping of Death
                Oversized packet
                    Size greater than 65535 bytes
                        System crashes
            UDP Flood
                Attacker floods target with UDP packets from spoofed IP
                Target checks for UDP service
                Target responds with 'Destination Unreachable' error
                Legit traffic can't access server
                    hping3 --flood --spoof 192.168.241.133 --udp -p 53 192.168.241.130
        Application
            HTTP
                Web services utilize HTTP Methods
                    GET
                    POST
                Attacker overwhelms Server by flooding it with GET/POST requests
                    LOIC DEMO
                Unintentional attack
                    Death of Michael Jackson
                        Stopped, slowed and even crashed
                            Google
                            Twitter
                    News/Link sites
                        Link goes viral and site gets overloaded by visits
                            Reddit Hug of Death
                            Digg Effect
