#Summary: what network segmentation is it is us looking for the fact that I've got a network here. Do I have other networks that I would have to tross through boundaries to get to? Or can I just see the entire thing?
- I mentioned PCI, PCI, is really good because it shows you the necessity. Say the necessity 100 times faster and you'll fall on your face. 
- Because they want to see that and they have specific guidelines for how that should look.

Network Segmentation Testing

YOU NEED TO READ THIS: https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/Guidance-PCI-DSS-Scoping-and-Segmentation_v1.pdf

    Describe the need for network segmentation and network segmentation testing
    List and define methods for performing network segmentation tests

    What is network segmentation testing?

    Why do we do it?
-        PCI-DSS 11.3.4 checkbox (PCI p.102)
-            “If segmentation is used to isolate the CDE from other networks, perform penetration tests at least annually and after any changes to segmentation controls/methods to verify that the segmentation methods are operational and effective, and isolate all out-of-scope systems from systems in the CDE.”

            CDE Systems
-                Any systems/devices that directly process, store or transmit sensitive authentication data (SAD) or cardholder data (CHD) or are directly connected to such systems/devices.
-                    These systems/devices are also sometimes referred to as Tier 1 or Category 1.

            Connected To or Security Impacting Systems
-                Are systems that provide services to the CDE or have connections to systems/devices in the CDE that could adversely affect the security of the systems/devices in the CDE.
-                    These systems/devices can also be referred to as “Shared Services”, Tier 2 or Category 2.

            Out of Scope Systems
-                Are systems that cannot connect to the CDE also referred to as Tier 3 or Category 3.


    How do we do it?
-        Use a tool

-            Nmap
- So it could be something as simple as n map. And honestly PCI allows for that. That is a viable solution to the network segmentation testing problem. Does that mean that's where you wanna go? Not absolutely. Sometimes that is the way you want to fly.

-            Metasploit Pro

- Metasploit because it's a pretty well known tool most people know about it, especially if you're getting into pen testing. And you can just run that tool, it has the capabilities of checking for that and not only that, but generating reports that you need to verify and show that you did the right thing. And in the format that's necessary for being compliant with something like a PCI DSS test.
