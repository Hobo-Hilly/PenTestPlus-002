Container Vulnerabilities
Objectives:

    Explain vulnerabilities common to Containers

    What is a container?
        Like a VM, but different
            No Virtualized OS, instead uses Host OS
            No Hypervisor, instead Container Engine

    Container Vulnerabilities

        Container software and Cloud deployment

            Docker
$ sudo docker pull busybox		# this is grabbing/downloading container image named busy box to the machine
$ sudo docker run -it busybox /bin/sh  # -it says you want a shell from busybox and command we want to run,(/bin/sh) start a bash shell
/#
/# uname -a	# show me the name and version of the OS in the container I am running

/# hostname		# get the randomly geneated password for your session
/# 45214785		# your randomly generated hostname for this session
/# ls /bin		# list your tools
$ sudo docker ps -a 	#shows you all instances you have running
$ sudo docker rm 'name of instance'

$ searchsploit docker 


            Kubernetes
- The container itself might not be vulnerable, but those platforms might have been because you and I do miss configurations all the time. They could be leaking secrets out. There are tools out there for you to check the security of things like kubernetes. Make sure that there's no public sensitive access to anything
- Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system for automating software deployment, scaling, and management. Google originally designed Kubernetes, but the Cloud Native Computing Foundation now maintains the project
- If I build an application inside of a container and that application of security issues, guess what? The container is the vulnerability, right? Because the application that you put into it or the software you install or that you pull and use and it has a known vulnerability. Thats going to give us access



            Amazon ECS


                Insecure secrets


                Weak authentication
                    Crappy passwords
                    No 2FA
                    Public access



        Apps that run in a container
            Web Apps
            Network services
            Software vulns
