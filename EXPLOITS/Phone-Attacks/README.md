Mobile Attacks
Objectives:

    List and define common vulnerabilities, attacks and tools used for pentesting mobile devices

    Attacks

        Reverse Engineering
            Decompilers
            Static/Dynamic Code Analysis
                Look for...
                    Creds
                    Keys
                    API info
            Mobile Security Framework(MobSF)

        Sandbox Analysis
            Typical task of malware analysts
            Load app into controlled, monitored environment
                See how the app behaves

        Spamming
            Phishing
            Malicious attachments

    Vulnerabilities
        Insecure Storage
            No encryption at-rest
            Removable media
        Passcode Vulnerabilities
            Weak passcodes
            Applications
                Frida may help bypassing authentication process
        Certificate Pinning
            Adding in malicious keys to bypass legit key
        Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
            Dependency Vulnerabilities
            Patching Fragmentation
                Multiple versions in the ecosystem
                    Results in patches that can't be applied
                    Patches don't exist
                    Just not installed
        Execution of Activities Using Root
            Over-Reach of Permissions
                May give an attacker a foothold into the system
        Biometrics Integration
            Using pictures
            Gummy Fingerprint
        Business Logic Vulnerabilities
