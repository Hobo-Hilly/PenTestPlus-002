ICS, SCADA, and IIoT Vulnerabilities
Objectives:

    List and describe common ICS, SCADA, and IIoT vulnerabilities

    What is OT, ICS, SCADA, IIoT?
        OT Operational Technology
            Encompassing term for ICS, SCADA, and IIoT
        ICS = Industrial Control Systems
            General term for SCADA and Distributed Control Systems(DCS)
        SCADA = Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
            Control System for industrial processes
            Multiple remote sites with local control systems and equipment
            Communication systems to connect the whole thing
# Supervisory control and data acquisition is a control system architecture comprising computers, networked data communications and graphical user interfaces for high-level supervision of machines and processes.
# Many industrial organizations rely on a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. It helps operators access actionable data and manage equipment. SCADA is a powerful control system that is designed to collect, analyze, and visualize data from industrial equipment.

        IIoT
            The convergence of OT and IT
                Using traditional IT infrastructure to manage OT devices

# The main difference between OT and IT devices is that OT devices control the physical world, while IT systems manage data.
# A programmable logic controller or programmable controller is an industrial computer that has been ruggedized and adapted for the control of manufacturing processes, such as assembly lines, machines, robotic devices, or any activity that requires high reliability, ease of programming, and process fault diagnosis. 

    ICS / SCADA / IIoT Security Challenges
        Plain Text Passwords/Protocols
        Complexity
        Proprietary tech
        Legacy Tech
        Lack of security professionals
        Converging with IT brings in IT Security issues

        OT Vulnerabilities
            Internet-connected OT systems
            OT System connected to system that is connected to Internet
            Missing or Non-existent updates
            Weak passwords and/or no authentication
            Weak firewall rules (ingress/egress)
            Non-existent network segmentation
            Weak or non-existent encryption
