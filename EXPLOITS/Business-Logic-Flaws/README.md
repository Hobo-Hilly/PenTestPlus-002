Business Logic Flaws  # APPLICATION LOGIC FLAW
Objectives:


 - Ultimately a business logic flaws or an application logic flaw or just a logic flaw maybe more generally is what it allows us to do is to 
 - bypass steps.
 
 - That's what we mean by a logic flaw. Someone didn't think their way logically through from point A to point Z. And the areas in between get 
 - a little muddy and allow you to kind of just walk around and do things and click buttons that you might not or you should not have access 
 - to or capabilities therein.
 - Don't trust user input. Trusting users and where they can give you information and trusting that that information is what you expect it to be. Making a bad assumption
 - I've noticed that trusting user input tends to be one of the major root causes of just about a lot of attacks.
