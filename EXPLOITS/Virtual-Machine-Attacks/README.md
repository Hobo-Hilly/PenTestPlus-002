    VM Escape

# I wanna escape from the VM you have me in and cross to one of probably two major areas. Which would be other virtual machines that's being hosted on this platform and the underlying operating system. >> Right. >> The actual host, right, the host machine itself

        Virtualization detection
            Check the NIC
                wmic baseboard get manufacturer,product
                ipconfig /all
                https://dnschecker.org/mac-lookup.php
            Check disk type
                ls -l /dev/disk/by-id
            Look for VMware Tools install or Drag-n-Drop
                C:\Program Files\VMWare
                /tmp
        Check exploit-db for 'vm escape'
