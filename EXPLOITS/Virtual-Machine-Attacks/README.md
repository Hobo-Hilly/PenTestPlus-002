Virtual Environment Vulnerabilities
Objectives:

    Describe vulnerabilities common to Virtual Machines

    VM Escape

# I wanna escape from the VM you have me in and cross to one of probably two major areas. Which would be other virtual machines that's being hosted on this platform and the underlying operating system. >> Right. >> The actual host, right, the host machine itself
# One way is that I can do it is to start looking at the network interface card, right? That is a great way to see whether or not you're actually in a virtual environment. 

        Ability to break out from the virtual environment
-            Direct access to other virtual environments
-            Direct access to underlying host operating system

        Virtualization detection
            Check the NIC
-(cmd)            >    wmic baseboard get manufacturer,product
-(cmd)            >    ipconfig /all   # look at the Description catagorey
-(linux)	$ ip addr
-(linux)	Copy and Paste -link/ether 00:0c:27:ae:bd:f5 (this is a mac address*)   into the website dnschecker.org     # this will check the OUI 
- 												(Organizatio Unique Identifyer)

            Check disk type
-                ls -l /dev/disk/by-id  
#sample output

            Look for VMware Tools install or Drag-n-Drop
# If you see this directory in the tmp folder this means that you are able to Drag and Drop files from the Virtual Environment into the Host OS
-(cmd)                C:\Program Files\VMWare
-(linux)                /tmp
-(linux)                You also have directory  'vmware-root_575-47561429' in the tmp folder. These are the tools installed with the Vitrual Environment
